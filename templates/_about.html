        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>

            <p>The world is full of issues that need to be addressed. Everything matters to someone, we just want to do
                our part to help provide solutions for those who need assistance </p>

        <h2>Our Method</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>We take a wholistic approach, numbers are just numbers. We assign them value. The analysis is only half
                the battle. Interpreting the data requires an understanding of how and why we arrived at the end product.
                Only then can actionable advice be given.</li>
            <li>We treat data the same way you act in your grandmother's bridge game, respectful, thankful for the
                opportunity and everything stays at the table. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Values</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Simplicity: </li>
            <li>Creativity: Originality sparks progress</li>
            <li>Community: Growth requires collaboration</li>
            <li>Integrity: We promise data will never be sold</li>
            <li>Patience: It is impossible, until it isnâ€™t</li>
            <li>Curiosity: Ask, Act, Assess, Again</li>
            <li>Accountability: You cannot always be right but you can always learn from your actions</li>
        </ul>
